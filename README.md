# Analysis of InstaCart Open Sourced Dataset using Machine Learning

## Skills Exhibited: Data Cleanup, Exploratory Data Analysis, Python, Supervised Machine Learning, Unsupervised Machine Learning

In this project, we are working on Instacart dataset. As per the description shared on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/overview), Instacart open sourced this data - see their blog post on [3 Million Instacart Orders, Open Sourced](https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2).   

Our objective is to analyze this dataset and to provide insights in the form of:     

1. Exploratory Data Analysis   
2. Customer Segmentation on Instacart dataset    
3. Classification Model to Predict whether a customer will reorder or not
